[Live Application](US-GDP-bar-chart-dlzl.surge.sh)

## Project Goals

Application was completed as a freeCodeCamp [challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/visualize-data-with-a-bar-chart).

1. User Story: I can see US Gross Domestic Product by quarter, over time.

2. User Story: I can mouse over a bar and see a tooltip with the GDP amount and exact year and month that bar represents.

3. Hint: Here's a dataset you can use to build this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/GDP-data.json
